# Supported Snyk command line arguments:

* `--gradle-sub-project=foo` return dependencies for a specific subproject (by default, return only the
  dependencies for the top-level project)

Additional command line arguments:

- `--all-sub-projects` for "multi project" configurations, test all sub-projects.

- `--configuration-matching=<string>` Resolve dependencies using only configuration(s) that match the provided Java regular expression, e.g. '^releaseRuntimeClasspath$'.

- `--configuration-attributes=<string>` Select certain values of configuration attributes to resolve the dependencies. E.g.: 'buildtype:release,usage:java-runtime'

## Under the hood

See `lib/init.gradle` for the Groovy script injected in Gradle builds to gather and resolve the dependencies.
