.TH "SNYK\-MONITOR" "1" "August 2021" "Snyk.io"
.SH "NAME"
\fBsnyk\-monitor\fR \- Snapshot and continuously monitor your project
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsnyk\fR \fBmonitor\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Create a project on the Snyk website that will be continuously monitored for new vulnerabilities\. After running this command you will see it by logging in to the website and viewing Your projects\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
To see command\-specific flags and usage, see \fBhelp\fR command, e\.g\. \fBsnyk container \-\-help\fR\. For advanced usage, we offer language and context specific flags, listed further down this document\.
.TP
\fB\-\-all\-projects\fR
(only in \fBtest\fR and \fBmonitor\fR commands) Auto\-detect all projects in working directory
.TP
\fB\-\-detection\-depth\fR=\fIDEPTH\fR
(only in \fBtest\fR and \fBmonitor\fR commands) Use with \-\-all\-projects or \-\-yarn\-workspaces to indicate how many sub\-directories to search\. \fBDEPTH\fR must be a number\.
.IP
Default: 4 (the current working directory and 3 sub\-directories)
.TP
\fB\-\-exclude\fR=\fIDIRECTORY\fR[,\fIDIRECTORY\fR]\|\.\|\.\|\.>
(only in \fBtest\fR and \fBmonitor\fR commands) Can be used with \-\-all\-projects and \-\-yarn\-workspaces to indicate sub\-directories and files to exclude\. Must be comma separated\.
.IP
If using with \fB\-\-detection\-depth\fR exclude ignores directories at any level deep\.
.TP
\fB\-\-prune\-repeated\-subdependencies\fR, \fB\-p\fR
(only in \fBtest\fR and \fBmonitor\fR commands) Prune dependency trees, removing duplicate sub\-dependencies\. Will still find all vulnerabilities, but potentially not all of the vulnerable paths\.
.TP
\fB\-\-print\-deps\fR
(only in \fBtest\fR and \fBmonitor\fR commands) Print the dependency tree before sending it for analysis\.
.TP
\fB\-\-remote\-repo\-url\fR=\fIURL\fR
Set or override the remote URL for the repository that you would like to monitor\.
.TP
\fB\-\-dev\fR
Include development\-only dependencies\. Applicable only for some package managers\. E\.g\. \fIdevDependencies\fR in npm or \fI:development\fR dependencies in Gemfile\.
.IP
Default: scan only production dependencies
.TP
\fB\-\-org\fR=\fIORG_NAME\fR
Specify the \fIORG_NAME\fR to run Snyk commands tied to a specific organization\. This will influence where will new projects be created after running \fBmonitor\fR command, some features availability and private tests limits\. If you have multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI using:
.IP
\fB$ snyk config set org\fR=\fIORG_NAME\fR
.IP
Setting a default will ensure all newly monitored projects will be created under your default organization\. If you need to override the default, you can use the \fB\-\-org\fR=\fIORG_NAME\fR argument\.
.IP
Default: uses \fIORG_NAME\fR that sets as default in your Account settings \fIhttps://app\.snyk\.io/account\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-file\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Sets a package file\.
.IP
When testing locally or monitoring a project, you can specify the file that Snyk should inspect for package information\. When ommitted Snyk will try to detect the appropriate file for your project\.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-policy\fR
Ignores all set policies\. The current policy in \fB\.snyk\fR file, Org level ignores and the project policy on snyk\.io\.
.TP
\fB\-\-trust\-policies\fR
Applies and uses ignore rules from your dependencies\' Snyk policies, otherwise ignore policies are only shown as a suggestion\.
.TP

.TP
\fB\-\-policy\-path\fR=\fIPATH_TO_POLICY_FILE\fR`

.TP
\fB\-\-json\fR
Prints results in JSON format\.
.TP
\fB\-\-json\-file\-output\fR=\fIOUTPUT_FILE_PATH\fR
(only in \fBtest\fR command) Save test output in JSON format directly to the specified file, regardless of whether or not you use the \fB\-\-json\fR option\. This is especially useful if you want to display the human\-readable test output via stdout and at the same time save the JSON format output to a file\.
.TP
\fB\-\-sarif\fR
Return results in SARIF format\.
.TP
\fB\-\-sarif\-file\-output\fR=\fIOUTPUT_FILE_PATH\fR
(only in \fBtest\fR command) Save test output in SARIF format directly to the \fIOUTPUT_FILE_PATH\fR file, regardless of whether or not you use the \fB\-\-sarif\fR option\.
